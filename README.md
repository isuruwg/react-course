# 1. Getting Started

## 1.1. Creating a react app

You can create a new app by doing,

```npx create-react-app my-app```

However, for the first app we'll use, 

```npx create-react-app my-first-app --scripts-version 1.1.5```

This will create the same app structure as used in the course.

## 1.2. Starting the app

```
cd my-first-app
yarn start
```

# 2. Next Generation JavaScript

# 3. Base Features and Syntax

Please create a new app by following the guidelines in the section above.
